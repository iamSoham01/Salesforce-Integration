This project demonstrates various implementations of Salesforce integration with popular third-party providers like Google, LinkedIn, ChatGPT, and others, leveraging the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. 

By exploring these examples, you'll gain hands-on experience with establishing secure connections and exchanging data between these platforms and Salesforce.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
* A Salesforce org with appropriate permissions for creating apps and managing integrations.
* Familiarity with Salesforce development concepts like Apex, Visualforce, or LWC (optional).

### Clone or Download the Repository:
```bash
  https://github.com/iamSoham01/Salesforce-Integration.git
```
Or download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository.

### Set Up Your Development Environment:
* Follow Salesforce's official documentation for setting up your development environment, including installing tools like Salesforce DX and the Salesforce CLI.

### Key Concepts:

**OAuth 2.0:**  This industry-standard authorization framework enables applications to securely access user data from other services without requiring users to share their credentials directly with those services.

**Creating a Third-Party App:** You'll need to create apps within each provider (e.g., Google, LinkedIn) to obtain the necessary client credentials (client ID, client secret) for establishing the connection.

**Salesforce Auth Provider:** This component holds the provider-specific configuration, including the client credentials and API endpoints for interacting with the provider.

**External Credential and Named Credential:** These secure mechanisms allow you to store and manage access tokens and refresh tokens, which are crucial for maintaining ongoing connections with the third-party services.

**Apex Classes:** These classes provide the programmatic logic for interacting with the third-party APIs using the obtained access tokens.

### Examples:

This repository includes multiple examples showcasing different ways to integrate with various providers using OAuth 2.0. Explore each example to understand the specific steps and considerations involved.
